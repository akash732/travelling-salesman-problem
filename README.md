•	Consider city 1 as the starting and ending point. Since the route is cyclic, we can consider any point as a starting point.
•	Generate all (n-1)! permutations of cities.
•	Calculate the cost of every permutation and keep track of the minimum cost permutation.
•	Return the permutation with minimum cost.
